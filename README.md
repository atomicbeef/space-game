# Space game
An attempt to make a more fleshed out, single player version of [my multiplayer ship designer](https://github.com/atomicbeef/ship-designer).

## Features
- Voxel building
- Character controller with flashlight
- Custom shader material for ships that are being built
- A lot of faffing around with Bevy to try to make [big_space](https://crates.io/crates/big_space) (for very large sized worlds) and [bevy_rapier](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_rapier3d) (physics engine) play well together
